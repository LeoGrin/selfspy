# When we see a backspace pressed we want to know :
#       1) what was the erased key ?
#       2) what was the replaced key ? (the key you were supposed to type)

# Notes :

# Careful with inversion :
# ..s<[Backspace]>ts is probably a inversion of t and s and not simply "t instead of s"

# Careful with number of backspace:
# <[Backspace]x2> should be dealt with

# Careful with other command:
# <[Alt : Backspace]> count as a backspace
# but <Left><Enter><[Backspace]> makes it hard to know what was the erased letter : this backspace should not be counted
